                    "Waiting helps you as an investor and a lot of people just can‚Äôt stand to wait. If you didn‚Äôt get the deferred-gratification gene, you‚Äôve got to work very hard to overcome that. Charlie Munger",

Peter Lynch",

After nearly fifty years in this business, I don‚Äôt know anybody who has done it successfully and consistently. I don‚Äôt even know anybody who knows anybody who has. Jack Bogle",
                    "Though tempting, trying to time the market is a loser‚Äôs game. $10,000 continuously invested in the market over the past 20 years grew to more than $48,000. If you missed just the best 30 days, your investment was reduced to $9,900. Christopher Davis",

                    "A 10% decline in the market is fairly common‚Äîit happens about once a year. Investors who realize this are less likely to sell in a panic, and more likely to remain invested, benefitting from the wealthbuilding power of stocks. Christopher Davis",
                    "In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it is a weighing machine. Benjamin Graham",
                    "A market downturn doesn‚Äôt bother us. It is an opportunity to increase our ownership of great companies with great management at good prices. Warren Buffett",
                    "The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists. Benjamin Graham",
