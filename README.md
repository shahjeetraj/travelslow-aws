# Indian Stock Investment Suggestor

This Python program is an investment analysis tool that fetches key indicators for a list of stocks and provides investment recommendations based on various metrics.
Metrics used are - Market Capitalization, PE Ratio, Dividend Yield, Gross Margin and PB Ratio.
While most data and analysis is available on yfinance, it is tough for anyone to analyse thousands of stocks.
Our Aim is help investors find the safest and best stocks to invest within minutes.

#### Audio Script:
Hi I am jeetraj from mumbai, india. My Project is on finding Investment opportunity in the National Stock Exchange of India.â€‹ My Project title is  "Indian Stocks Investment Suggestor" and I have used my knowledge that I acquired from my Masters in Finance as well as my years of experience as a successful Investor. I am sure you already know Stock Market returns are by far the highest when compared to any other investment modes and these days it has become very simple to invest in them.
So, lets start to see what we have in store.
Here is some very fancy ASCII Art to welcome everyone, followed by a very famous investment quote. These quotes change every time you visit us. As you see on the screen we pick up the stocks data from a csv file and fetch all the data for thousands of stocks. This takes around 3 to 5 minutes but for this video, I will speed it up.
So now, we have all the data downloaded and users can select what Indicator do they want to start with for receiving the investment recommendation.
I will select option 1. For which I will be typing 1 and hitting Enter or Return key.
Wonderful, You will get top 10 companies by Market Capitalization. These look very safe to invest in right away. But lets look for more by saying "y" on screen and there you have 10 more stock recommendations.
Wow, I will now say "n" for more recommendations since I want to see other indicators as well.
We need to say "y" for continuing to do our investment research. At this point we can now go to option 2 which is PE or Price to Earning Ratio.
The recommendations based on PE Ratio looks good as these are some undervalued companies.
So now you have an idea how to go on looking at different indicator based recommendations. I challenge you to find out the best stocks to invest using this program and keep coming back for more recommendations since all data analysis happens on latest results posted by companies.
